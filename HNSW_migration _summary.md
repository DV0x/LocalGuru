# HNSW Vector Index Migration Summary

We successfully migrated from IVFFlat indexes with 1536-dimensional vectors to more efficient HNSW indexes with 512-dimensional vectors. Here's what we accomplished:

## Schema Changes

1. **Cleared existing data** by truncating the content_representations table to start fresh
2. **Modified vector dimension** from 1536 to 512 to reduce storage requirements and improve performance
3. **Removed old IVFFlat indexes** that were no longer needed

## HNSW Index Implementation

1. **Created new HNSW indexes** with optimized parameters:
   - Main index on all representations with `m=24, ef_construction=200`
   - Specialized indexes for 'title' and 'context_enhanced' representation types
   - Used L2 distance (`vector_l2_ops`) for similarity calculations

2. **Updated store_content_representation function** to:
   - Work with 512-dimensional vectors
   - Restrict representation types to only 'title' and 'context_enhanced'

3. **Added vector_search helper function** with:
   - Customizable ef_search parameter for query-time control
   - Support for filtering by representation type and content type
   - Built-in subreddit filtering capability

This migration provides significant performance improvements for vector similarity searches, especially for large datasets, by leveraging HNSW's hierarchical graph structure and reduced dimensionality.
