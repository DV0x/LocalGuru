# Phase 4: Core Processing Implementation - Complete

## Implemented Components

### 1. Change Detector (`src/processors/change-detector.ts`)
- Implements the `ChangeDetector` class that tracks content changes using checksums
- Features:
  - MD5 checksums generation for tracking content changes
  - Forced updates after configurable time periods
  - Separate change detection for posts and comments
  - Maintains update counts and preserves certain fields across updates

### 2. Database Handler (`src/db/db-handler.ts`)
- Implements the `DBHandler` class for managing database operations
- Features:
  - Batch processing for better performance
  - Trigger control for bulk operations
  - Support for fetching, inserting, and updating posts and comments
  - Error handling with logging and retries

### 3. Queue Manager (`src/queue/queue-manager.ts`)
- Implements the `QueueManager` class for the embedding queue
- Features:
  - Configurable priority mapping for different content types
  - Duplicate detection and updating
  - Cooldown periods for updates
  - Queue cleanup for maintenance

### 4. Integration
- Updated main `index.ts` to demonstrate the core processing workflow:
  - Fetching data from Reddit
  - Detecting changes
  - Updating the database
  - Queueing content for embedding
  - Cleaning up the queue

### 5. Testing
- Added `test-change-detector.ts` script for verifying change detection logic
- Added npm script for running tests: `npm run test:change-detector`

## Configuration
The configuration in `config.ts` includes:
- Change detection parameters (checksum fields, ignored fields, update frequency)
- Database options (batch size, retries, trigger control)
- Queue settings (priorities, sizes, cooldowns)

## Next Steps
Phase 4 is now complete. The system can:
1. Fetch data from Reddit
2. Detect new and changed content
3. Update the database accordingly
4. Queue items for embedding with appropriate priorities

Ready to proceed to Phase 5: Processing Queue Management & Embedding.
