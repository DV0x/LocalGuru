# Search Engine Implementation Plan

## 1. Complete Supabase Setup
- Fix the module not found error in the setup script
- Successfully run the script to enable pgvector extension
- Create all necessary tables for storing Reddit posts, embeddings, and query logs
- Test the connection between the application and Supabase

## 2. Implement Semantic Search Infrastructure
- Create a module to process Reddit content into embeddings
- Store these embeddings in Supabase using pgvector
- Implement vector similarity search functionality
- Test the semantic search with sample queries

## 3. Develop RAG Pipeline
- Build the prompt construction logic to combine user queries with relevant Reddit data
- Create the LLM integration module to generate responses based on enriched prompts
- Implement response formatting to structure LLM output for frontend consumption
- Test the complete RAG workflow

## 4. Build Frontend Components
- Develop the search UI with text input and voice command functionality
- Create result card components to display LLM-generated recommendations
- Implement loading and error states for user feedback
- Connect frontend to backend API endpoints

## 5. Create Main API Endpoint
- Develop the `/api/query` endpoint that:
  - Receives user queries
  - Performs semantic search
  - Enriches the query with relevant Reddit data
  - Calls the LLM for response generation
  - Returns formatted results to the frontend

## 6. Implement Data Refresh Strategy
- Set up background jobs to periodically fetch new Reddit content
- Process and compute embeddings for new data
- Update the vector index incrementally

## 7. Testing and Refinement
- Perform end-to-end testing of the complete application flow
- Optimize semantic search performance
- Implement caching strategies for API responses
- Refine UI/UX based on testing feedback
