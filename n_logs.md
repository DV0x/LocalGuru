Coit Tower is also near by for some good city views.\n\nA classic is a picnic in Dolores park! Easy to bring in delicious Mission Mexican food, very queer centric, and close to the J Church for easy cruising to Mitchell‚Äôs or El Rio, but also an easy walk to Mother and Bi Rite Creamery. Also prime people watching on nice days.\n\nIf the weather isn‚Äôt great the Sunnyside Conservatory by Glenn Park BART seems like it would be a great spot for staying warm and dry but still getting some nature in. Take this one with a grain of salt cus it‚Äôs still on my to-do list. \n\nOther possibilities include visiting the concrete slides in the city or Golden Gate Park. \n\nEnjoy!","url":"https://reddit.com/comments/1jb6asv","subreddit":"AskSF","author":"variety-pack","created_at":"2025-03-14T18:41:01+00:00","index":2,"postTitle":"Romantic Date Ideas?

It's close to Union Square and public transit lines. You can walk north to Chinatown (through the tunnel) and head south to Union Square/Market Street. \n\n* Friday - add one or two more things. The Salesforce Park isn't massive so you could 'do it all' in 30 minutes to an hour. There's a lot of plants with plaques but I have never read them. The views are pretty good from the park though as you're in the middle of all the taller buildings in SF. I'd add on walking around Union Square to the friday evening itinerary since it's right by the hotel. \n* Saturday - you can take the F line from the Ferry Building to Pier 39. It's an old fashioned street car. It gets packed at the Ferry Building so if you want to get on just walk through the intersection to the Embarcadero stop or the stop at the San Francisco Railway Museum (to the left). Walk from Pier 39 to Fisherman's Wharf then along Aquatic Park over the hill to Fort Mason. The view from there is epic. You can then make your way to Chinatown. There's also Ghirardelli Factory in the middle of the walk if you want to stop for a sweet treat. If you're over 21, Buena Vista is on the route (next to the cable car turnaround) and has their famous irish coffee. You can then take Muni to North Beach and work your way from there into China Town - they're next to each other. LiPo has their famous Chinese Mai Tai's and there's plenty of shops and food options to explore. The Alcatraz tour makes sense to move to a weekday. It'll likely be less crowded. \n* Sunday - If the weather is good, locals will be at Dolores Park having picnics. You can get there easily on the J line. There's two stops at the park and the second one has one of the best views you'll see in SF. You can go from there to the mission to grab a burrito. Alternatively, you can grab a burrito first and work your way back. There's a popular ice cream spot called Bi-rite across from the northeast corner of the park. You can walk/hike from Dolores Park to the famous Seven Sisters at Alamo Square park. The views are great here too and you'll see more tourists hanging out here. Down the hill to Divisadero street has many places to eat if you want to eat there. You could also look along Fillmore towards Pac Heights for upscale-ish options. \n* Monday - Be sure to stop by the Bison Paddock. There is the Cal Academy of Sciences that might be appealing to her. The Rose Garden can be hit or miss if they're in bloom. They smell great if they are but if not it's just a seemingly empty space. I'd do the Botanical Garden instead. She'll love the plants there. There's a patch of redwoods too. I'd consider passing on the boat rental. You can see everything from the lake by walking around/over it. It's going to be a big time commitment but it could be good for the novelty. Walk by the area to get a feel if it's appealing enough. After the park, if you go to Ocean Beach you could make your way up to Sutro Baths and/or Lands End Trail (if it's still daytime). There's some really good views of the Golden Gate Bridge. Also, before you go to the park you could start in Haight Ashbury and explore the shops. It's got a 60s/70s vintage feel to it. You could take the N line into Cole Valley and walk a few blocks to the area. This will give you a glimpse of CV which I think is one of the cutest neighborhoods in SF. \n* Tuesday - If you haven't been near the Golden Gate Bridge you could go to Presidio Tunnel Tops and Crissy Field to get a close up view. You'll be able to see how massive it is from that perspective and it's something you need to see in person to appreciate. It's also close to the Palace of Fine Arts which is a popular spot for pictures. Since she loves books and I haven't seen much mention of book-related things it might be worth finding something to do that aligns to that interest. Green Apple seems to be highly recommended. There are two locations, one is on the edge of GGP and the other is in the richmond where you can explore clement street after.","url":"https://reddit.com/comments/1iyvqwc","subreddit":"AskSF","author":"moneyxmaker","created_at":"2025-02-26T20:12:12+00:00","index":38,"postTitle":"April 11-16 Trip","contentType":"comment"},{"id":"mmh8xk8","title":"Planning my 27th birthday - Picnic Area Reccos?","snippet":"Thank you!

It's close to Union Square and public transit lines. You can walk north to Chinatown (through the tunnel) and head south to Union Square/Market Street. \n\n* Friday - add one or two more things. The Salesforce Park isn't massive so you could 'do it all' in 30 minutes to an hour. There's a lot of plants with plaques but I have never read them. The views are pretty good from the park though as you're in the middle of all the taller buildings in SF. I'd add on walking around Union Square to the friday evening itinerary since it's right by the hotel. \n* Saturday - you can take the F line from the Ferry Building to Pier 39. It's an old fashioned street car. It gets packed at the Ferry Building so if you want to get on just walk through the intersection to the Embarcadero stop or the stop at the San Francisco Railway Museum (to the left). Walk from Pier 39 to Fisherman's Wharf then along Aquatic Park over the hill to Fort Mason. The view from there is epic. You can then make your way to Chinatown. There's also Ghirardelli Factory in the middle of the walk if you want to stop for a sweet treat. If you're over 21, Buena Vista is on the route (next to the cable car turnaround) and has their famous irish coffee. You can then take Muni to North Beach and work your way from there into China Town - they're next to each other. LiPo has their famous Chinese Mai Tai's and there's plenty of shops and food options to explore. The Alcatraz tour makes sense to move to a weekday. It'll likely be less crowded. \n* Sunday - If the weather is good, locals will be at Dolores Park having picnics. You can get there easily on the J line. There's two stops at the park and the second one has one of the best views you'll see in SF. You can go from there to the mission to grab a burrito. Alternatively, you can grab a burrito first and work your way back. There's a popular ice cream spot called Bi-rite across from the northeast corner of the park. You can walk/hike from Dolores Park to the famous Seven Sisters at Alamo Square park. The views are great here too and you'll see more tourists hanging out here. Down the hill to Divisadero street has many places to eat if you want to eat there. You could also look along Fillmore towards Pac Heights for upscale-ish options. \n* Monday - Be sure to stop by the Bison Paddock. There is the Cal Academy of Sciences that might be appealing to her. The Rose Garden can be hit or miss if they're in bloom. They smell great if they are but if not it's just a seemingly empty space. I'd do the Botanical Garden instead. She'll love the plants there. There's a patch of redwoods too. I'd consider passing on the boat rental. You can see everything from the lake by walking around/over it. It's going to be a big time commitment but it could be good for the novelty. Walk by the area to get a feel if it's appealing enough. After the park, if you go to Ocean Beach you could make your way up to Sutro Baths and/or Lands End Trail (if it's still daytime). There's some really good views of the Golden Gate Bridge. Also, before you go to the park you could start in Haight Ashbury and explore the shops. It's got a 60s/70s vintage feel to it. You could take the N line into Cole Valley and walk a few blocks to the area. This will give you a glimpse of CV which I think is one of the cutest neighborhoods in SF. \n* Tuesday - If you haven't been near the Golden Gate Bridge you could go to Presidio Tunnel Tops and Crissy Field to get a close up view. You'll be able to see how massive it is from that perspective and it's something you need to see in person to appreciate. It's also close to the Palace of Fine Arts which is a popular spot for pictures. Since she loves books and I haven't seen much mention of book-related things it might be worth finding something to do that aligns to that interest. Green Apple seems to be highly recommended. There are two locations, one is on the edge of GGP and the other is in the richmond where you can explore clement street after.","url":"https://reddit.com/comments/1iyvqwc","subreddit":"AskSF","author":"moneyxmaker","created_at":"2025-02-26T20:12:12+00:00","index":38,"postTitle":"April 11-16 Trip","contentType":"comment"},{"id":"mmh8xk8","title":"Planning my 27th birthday - Picnic Area Reccos?","snippet":"Thank you!
