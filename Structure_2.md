- **Content**: I am brown and been living in down town for almost a decade. So this list is heavily based around Tenderloin and SoMA 

Pakwan for Biryani and Nihari specials
Chutney for Chicken Tikka Masala and lamb chops
Red Chilli for their chicken Karahi

Kinara for everything. Never had a bad thing there. Their fusions are great especially Paneer Tikka their BBQ platter and deserts like Falooda. 

Aslam Rasoi for their Okra in mission. Sad to see them close.

Zareen's in Palo Alto is good for everything. Their weekend Nihari and Halwa Puri is out of this world.

I am not into South Indian food too much but had some good dosa at Updhai place and Chat corner.

The food is incredible. You will not be disappointed. Definitely try the palak chaat.

Plus, owner Rita is a delight. She grew up in Tenderloin and is all sass and heart. 

This is yet another Clement Street hidden gem.

- **Content**: I love Aslam's Rasoi which unfortunately is going to have to move or close soon, but has consistently the best Indian food I've eaten in the bay area. The mission is getting a lot of new Indian spots too though so plenty of options for variety.

- **Content**: It's worth a trip across the bridge to Ajanta in Berkeley. The owner, Lachu Moorjani, is very serious about faithfully representing regional styles. Until I first ate at Ajanta I never realized how many Indian restaurants (even good ones) have their own limited wheelhouse of sauces and spices that they overextend to other dishes that aren't their speciality. Ajanta is more subtle and has a lot of variety, but it's all so good.
