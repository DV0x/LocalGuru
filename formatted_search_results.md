### Result #19
- **Content**: "No drones are allowed in the port area, any city parks, state parks, or on federal lands* in San Francisco. There is some national security airspace around shipping lanes and the Golden Gate Bridge. That rules out 100% of the coastline and all public green space. Plus there are airspace restrictions in the south-east for SFO, and 3 nautical miles around Oracle Park during MLB games/events.\n\nHaving a smaller drone just means you don't have to register with the FAA in advance; you still have to follow all airspace restrictions and ground based rules.\n\nYou're going to need to be on private property without any airspace restrictions, pretty much. Good luck finding that within SF, with the exception of SF Drone School.\n\n*ETA: Fort Funston is allowed when there are no hang-gliders or paragliders in the air. https://www.nps.gov/goga/learn/news/no-drone-zone.htm"
