# Enhanced Intent Detection System - Test Results

## Overview
We've successfully tested the enhanced intent detection system with two different queries to verify that it correctly identifies intents and returns relevant results.

## Test 1: "where can i sit and work in sf?"

### Query Analysis
- **Detected Intent**: recommendation
- **Topics**: workspaces, San Francisco
- **Locations**: sf

### Search Results
- **Number of Results**: 23
- **Top Results**:
  - "Places to study AND avoid home?" - Multiple results with location boosting
  - Results included various recommendations for places to work in SF, including:
    - Stonestown Whole Foods sitting area
    - Hyatt Regency lobby in downtown SF
    - Salesforce building seating areas
    - LinkedIn building lobby
    - Various coffee shops and public spaces

### Observations
- The system correctly identified this as a recommendation intent
- Location boosting was applied to results in San Francisco
- The results were highly relevant to the query, providing specific places to sit and work in SF
- The similarity scores were high (>1.0 for top results), indicating strong matches

## Test 2: "Want to meet people who dont have kids"

### Query Analysis
- **Detected Intent**: how_to
- **Topics**: meeting people, having kids
- **Locations**: None detected

### Search Results

- Context enhancement was applied to most results
- Topic boosting was applied to some results
- The results were highly relevant to the query, focusing on meeting people without children
- The similarity scores were good (0.87-0.95), indicating strong matches

## Conclusion
The enhanced intent detection system is working effectively:

1. **Accurate Intent Detection**: The system correctly identified the intents for both test queries
2. **Relevant Topic Extraction**: Topics were accurately extracted from the queries
3. **Location Recognition**: When locations were present in the query, they were correctly identified
4. **Effective Boosting**: The appropriate boosting strategies were applied based on the detected intent:
   - Location boosting for recommendation queries
   - Context enhancement and topic boosting for how_to queries
5. **High-Quality Results**: The search results were highly relevant to the queries, with good similarity scores

The enhanced intent system has successfully improved search relevance by applying intent-specific boosting strategies, resulting in more targeted and useful search results for users.
