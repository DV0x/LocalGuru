Coit Tower is also near by for some good city views.\n\nA classic is a picnic in Dolores park! Easy to bring in delicious Mission Mexican food, very queer centric, and close to the J Church for easy cruising to Mitchell’s or El Rio, but also an easy walk to Mother and Bi Rite Creamery. Also prime people watching on nice days.\n\nIf the weather isn’t great the Sunnyside Conservatory by Glenn Park BART seems like it would be a great spot for staying warm and dry but still getting some nature in. Take this one with a grain of salt cus it’s still on my to-do list. \n\nOther possibilities include visiting the concrete slides in the city or Golden Gate Park. \n\nEnjoy!","url":"https://reddit.com/comments/1jb6asv","subreddit":"AskSF","author":"variety-pack","created_at":"2025-03-14T18:41:01+00:00","index":3,"postTitle":"Romantic Date Ideas?
