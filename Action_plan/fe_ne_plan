# Integration Plan for New Design

Based on my analysis of both the existing codebase and the new design document, here's a step-by-step plan to integrate the new visual style without changing backend functionality:

## 1. Update Dependencies & Configuration

```bash
npm install lucide-react
npm install tailwindcss-animate -D
```

## 2. Update Tailwind Configuration

- Update `tailwind.config.ts` with the new theme configuration from the implementation document
- Add the new colors, animations, and design elements from the futuristic/Y2K palette

## 3. Update Global CSS

- Update `app/globals.css` with the new CSS variables and component styles
- Ensure we keep current component styles that might be used elsewhere in the app

## 4. Component Updates (Phased Approach)

### Phase 1: Core UI Components
1. Update/Replace `components/search-bar.tsx` with the new design
2. Update/Replace `components/result-card.tsx` with the new design
3. Update/Replace `components/streaming-results.tsx` with the new design

### Phase 2: New Components
1. Create `components/location-selector.tsx` (new component)
2. Create `components/scrolling-banner.tsx` (new component)

### Phase 3: Main Page Update
1. Update `app/page.tsx` to incorporate new components while keeping existing functionality
   - Maintain both traditional search and AI streaming search
   - Add location selector to the UI
   - Implement scrolling banner if needed

## 5. Hook/Logic Integration

- Keep existing hooks and logic for search (`useStreamingSearch`)
- Keep existing API calls to `/api/search` and `/api/streaming-search`
- Integrate the new UI without changing the data flow

## 6. Testing Plan

1. Test core components in isolation
2. Test traditional search functionality with new UI
3. Test AI streaming search with new UI
4. Test responsive design across different screen sizes
5. Test accessibility of new components

## 7. Migration Considerations

- Consider implementing feature flags if a gradual rollout is needed
- Maintain backward compatibility for any third-party integrations
- Document any API changes needed for the frontend (even if backend remains unchanged)

This plan allows for a phased implementation of the new design while ensuring the backend functionality remains intact. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this plan?
