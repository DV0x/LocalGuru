# Implementation Plan

## Step 1: Project Setup and Environment Configuration

- **Initialize Next.js Project:**  
  - Set up using `create-next-app`.
  - Initialize version control (Git) and configure project structure.
- **Set Up Supabase:**  
  - Create a Supabase instance.
  - Set up database tables for caching Reddit posts, storing embeddings (with pgvector), and logging queries.
- **Environment Variables:**  
  - Configure and securely store API keys for Reddit, the LLM service (e.g., OpenAI), and embedding services.

## Step 2: Frontend Development

### 2.1 Build User Interface
- **Design the Main Search Page:**  
  - Include a text input field and a dedicated voice command button.
  - Ensure a clean, responsive layout.
- **Implement Voice-to-Text:**  
  - Integrate the Deepgram API to capture voice input and convert to text.
  - Provide UI feedback for unsupported browsers.

### 2.2 Develop Result Display Components
- **Card Layout Design:**  
  - Create card components to display key details (recommendations, descriptions, actionable insights).
- **Loading & Error States:**  
  - Incorporate animations and visual indicators during processing.

## Step 3: Backend API Development

### 3.1 Create API Endpoints
- **Query Endpoint:**  
  - Develop a Next.js API route (e.g., `/api/query`) that handles:
    - Receiving the user query.
    - Preprocessing and validation of input.
- **Integration with External Services:**  
  - Connect to Reddit API to retrieve curated travel-related data.
  - Interface with the embedding service to convert text into vector embeddings.
  - Connect to the LLM API for generating responses.

### 3.2 Implement Semantic Search
- **Embedding Generation and Storage:**
  - Develop a module to:
    - Process and convert relevant Reddit content into embeddings.
    - Store these embeddings in Supabase using the pgvector extension.
- **Vector Similarity Search:**  
  - Convert the incoming user query into an embedding.
  - Perform a semantic search against the pre-indexed Reddit data.
  - Retrieve the top semantically relevant documents.
- **Index Update Pipeline:**  
  - Set up background jobs (cron tasks) to:
    - Fetch new Reddit posts periodically.
    - Process and compute embeddings for new data.
    - Update the vector index incrementally.

## Step 4: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Workflow

### 4.1 Enrich the Query
- **Prompt Construction:**  
  - Combine the user's query with the top semantically matched Reddit data.
  - Ensure the prompt is detailed enough for the LLM to generate a precise answer.
  
### 4.2 LLM Integration
- **API Module for LLM:**  
  - Develop a module to call the LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT).
  - Send the enriched prompt and handle the response.
- **Response Formatting:**  
  - Parse the LLM output.
  - Structure the response in a JSON format that fits the card layout.

## Step 5: Frontend Integration with API

### 5.1 Connect Frontend to Backend
- **API Call from UI:**  
  - Integrate the search UI with the `/api/query` endpoint.
  - Send user queries and handle asynchronous responses.
  
### 5.2 Render Dynamic Content
- **Dynamic Card Rendering:**  
  - Parse the JSON response from the API.
  - Dynamically generate and display card components on the page.
- **User Interaction Enhancements:**  
  - Allow users to click on cards for more details.
  - Provide clear loading and error states.

## Step 6: Testing, Monitoring, and Optimization

### 6.1 Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing:**  
  - Test individual frontend components and backend modules.
- **Integration Testing:**  
  - Validate the full workflow from user input to the final LLM response.
- **Voice-to-Text Testing:**  
  - Ensure consistent performance across different browsers and devices.

### 6.2 Monitoring and Logging
- **Performance Monitoring:**  
  - Set up logging for API calls, semantic search latency, and LLM responses.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Implement robust error logging and user-friendly error messages.

### 6.3 Performance Optimization
- **Caching Strategies:**  
  - Cache Reddit data and LLM responses to reduce redundant calls.
- **Indexing Efficiency:**  
  - Regularly monitor and optimize the semantic search pipeline for speed.
