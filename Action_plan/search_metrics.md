<think>The user is asking about search evaluation metrics, specifically Precision@k, Recall@k, and wants to understand what these metrics mean and how they're calculated. I'll provide a comprehensive explanation of these common information retrieval evaluation metrics, including:

1. Precision@k
2. Recall@k
3. F1 Score
4. Mean Average Precision (MAP)
5. Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
6. Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)

I'll explain what each metric measures, when to use it, how to calculate it, and provide examples to illustrate the concepts.</think># Understanding Information Retrieval Evaluation Metrics

Information retrieval systems like semantic search engines need objective ways to measure their performance. Here's a breakdown of the key evaluation metrics:

## Precision@k

**What it measures**: The proportion of relevant results among the top k retrieved items.

**Formula**: 
```
Precision@k = (Number of relevant documents in top k results) / k
```

**Example**: 
- If 3 out of the top 5 results are relevant, Precision@5 = 3/5 = 0.6 (60%)

**When to use**: 
- When you care about the quality of the top results
- When users typically only look at the first page of results
- When showing too many irrelevant results is costly

## Recall@k

**What it measures**: The proportion of all relevant items that appear in the top k results.

**Formula**: 
```
Recall@k = (Number of relevant documents in top k results) / (Total number of relevant documents)
```

**Example**: 
- If there are 10 relevant documents in the dataset, and 4 appear in the top 10 results, Recall@10 = 4/10 = 0.4 (40%)

**When to use**: 
- When finding as many relevant items as possible is important
- When users need comprehensive information
- When missing relevant information is costly

## F1 Score

**What it measures**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.

**Formula**: 
```
F1 = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
```

**When to use**: 
- When you need a single metric that balances finding relevant items and avoiding irrelevant ones
- When neither precision nor recall alone captures what you care about

## Mean Average Precision (MAP)

**What it measures**: The mean of average precision scores across multiple queries.

**Calculation Process**:
1. For each relevant item, calculate precision at its position
2. Average these precision values to get Average Precision (AP) for a query
3. Take the mean AP across all test queries

**Example**:
- If relevant documents are at positions 1, 3, 5 in results:
  - Precision@1 = 1/1 = 1.0
  - Precision@3 = 2/3 = 0.67
  - Precision@5 = 3/5 = 0.6
  - AP = (1.0 + 0.67 + 0.6) / 3 = 0.76

**When to use**:
- When you have a test set with multiple queries
- When order of results matters
- When you need a comprehensive performance view

## Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG@k)

**What it measures**: How well the search results are ranked, taking into account the graded relevance of results.

**Formula**:
```
DCG@k = rel₁ + Σᵏᵢ₌₂ (relᵢ / log₂(i+1))
NDCG@k = DCG@k / IDCG@k
```
Where:
- relᵢ = relevance score of item at position i
- IDCG = DCG of the ideal ranking

**Example**:
- If relevance scores are [3, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2] for top 6 results:
  - DCG@6 = 3 + 2/log₂(3) + 3/log₂(4) + 0/log₂(5) + 1/log₂(6) + 2/log₂(7) ≈ 7.13
  - IDCG@6 (ideal ordering [3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 0]) ≈ 7.35
  - NDCG@6 = 7.13/7.35 ≈ 0.97

**When to use**:
- When results have different levels of relevance (not just relevant/irrelevant)
- When ranking quality matters (higher is better)
- When evaluating ranked lists where position matters

## Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)

**What it measures**: The average of the reciprocal ranks of the first relevant result for a set of queries.

**Formula**:
```
MRR = (1/|Q|) * Σᵍᵢ₌₁ (1/rankᵢ)
```
Where:
- |Q| = number of queries
- rankᵢ = position of first relevant result for query i

**Example**:
- For 3 queries where first relevant results are at positions 1, 4, and 2:
  - MRR = (1/3) * (1/1 + 1/4 + 1/2) = (1/3) * 1.75 ≈ 0.58

**When to use**:
- When you only care about the first relevant result
- For question-answering or factoid search scenarios
- When evaluating "find the answer quickly" use cases

## Visualizing the Difference

Here's a simple example showing how these metrics differ:

```
Query: "what are vector databases?"
Relevance scores (0-2): [2, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0]
                        ↑  ↑  ↑  ↑  ↑  ↑  ↑  ↑  ↑  ↑
Rank:                   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10

Precision@5 = 3/5 = 0.6
Recall@5 (assuming 6 relevant items total) = 3/6 = 0.5
NDCG@5 = 0.89 (calculated with the formula above)
MAP = 0.74 (average precision at ranks 1, 3, 4)
MRR = 1.0 (first relevant item is at rank 1)
```

## Implementing Evaluation in Your System

To implement a proper evaluation system for your search:

1. Create a test set of queries with known relevant results
2. Run each query through your search system
3. Calculate the metrics above based on the results
4. Use the metrics to compare different configurations

```typescript
function calculatePrecisionAtK(results, relevantIds, k) {
  const topK = results.slice(0, k);
  const relevantCount = topK.filter(r => relevantIds.includes(r.id)).length;
  return relevantCount / k;
}

function calculateRecallAtK(results, relevantIds, k) {
  const topK = results.slice(0, k);
  const relevantCount = topK.filter(r => relevantIds.includes(r.id)).length;
  return relevantCount / relevantIds.length;
}
```

By tracking these metrics, you can objectively assess changes to your search system and ensure that optimizations actually improve the user experience.

## Tracking System Workflow

1. **Daily Automated Testing**:
   - Run test query set against search system
   - Calculate core metrics
   - Store results in metrics database
   - Alert on significant regressions

2. **Weekly User Metrics Collection**:

   - Process any explicit feedback
   - Calculate user satisfaction metrics

3. **Monthly In-Depth Analysis**:
   - Identify strongest/weakest queries
   - Compare against benchmarks
   - Generate optimization recommendations
