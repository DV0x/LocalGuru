<think>The user is pointing out a very important principle for comprehensive information retrieval - we should analyze all available comments from a matched post when providing insights, rather than just a limited subset.

In our case, we're only analyzing a portion of the 87 total comments due to the LIMIT clauses in our queries. This means we could be missing valuable information that might help provide more complete answers.

For a truly robust search implementation, we should:
1. Process all comments, not just a limited number
2. Apply relevance scoring and semantic understanding to the full dataset
3. Only after analyzing everything, prioritize what to present to the user

The user is highlighting a weakness in our current approach - by limiting what we retrieve before analysis, we might be missing key insights.</think>You're absolutely right. For proper search and information retrieval, we should be analyzing all comments from a matched post to provide comprehensive insights, not just a subset. This is a critical limitation in our current implementation.

### Current Limitations in Our Approach

1. **Arbitrary Limits**: We're applying LIMIT clauses (15, 20, etc.) to our SQL queries, arbitrarily cutting off potentially valuable information.

2. **Pre-filtering Too Early**: We're filtering comments based on keywords before even analyzing them, which means we miss semantic relevance that doesn't contain our specific terms.

3. **Missing Context**: Comments often build on each other, so seeing only a subset breaks the conversation flow and can lead to incomplete understanding.

### Best Practices for Thorough Information Retrieval

When a user is looking for an answer about a topic (like "safest place in Mission"), we should:

1. **Retrieve All Content First**: Get all 87 comments without arbitrary limits

2. **Process Everything**: Apply our vector embeddings and relevance scoring to the complete dataset

3. **Rank After Analysis**: Only after understanding all comments should we rank and prioritize what to present

4. **Preserve Context**: Include related comments that provide context, even if they don't directly match keywords

5. **Present Balanced Results**: Show both supporting and contradicting viewpoints for a balanced perspective

This complete approach would give much more accurate and comprehensive results. Our current method is like reading only a few pages of a book and trying to summarize the whole story.

Would you like me to update our search methodology to follow these more comprehensive principles? I could create a new script that retrieves and analyzes all comments for more thorough insights.
