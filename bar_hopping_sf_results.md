Test run at: Wed Mar 12 15:16:27 IST 2025

## Step 1: Query Analysis
First, we'll analyze the query to see if 'sf' is normalized to 'San Francisco':

### Query Analysis Results:
- **Intent:** discovery
- **Topics:** bar hopping, nightlife
- **Entities Location:** sf
- **Top-level Locations:** San Francisco, San Francisco

✅ **LOCATION FIX SUCCESS:** 'sf' was correctly normalized to 'San Francisco'!

## Step 2: Generate Search Embeddings
Now we'll generate embeddings for the query:

Embedding generated (showing first 100 chars): -0.022179358,-0.02008112,0.05582157,0.005865208,-0.048808668,-0.024164937,-0.018475756,0.02788262,-0...

## Step 3: Search Results
Now we'll search for results using the enhanced intent search function:

### Search Results:

No results found.

## Conclusion
Out of the results returned, 0 explicitly mention 'sf'.

This confirms that our location normalization (sf → San Francisco) is working correctly
and we're still able to find posts that mention 'sf' even though we're using 'San Francisco'
in the search parameters.
