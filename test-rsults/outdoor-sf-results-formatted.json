            "No idea! In my forties, city girl, sober, and rarely go out. So, here we are. I had a delicious dinner in my cozy apartment on this lovely Saturday night, reconciling my Quicken and watching The Fourth State. I’m okay with it. I’m starting to think if it happens, great; if not, that’s okay, too.\n\nEdit: I have met people when I signed up for hobbies that interest me, such as outdoor survival, hiking, cycling, seaweed foraging, or sailing—there are so many fun things to do in the bay. \n\nFind hobbies you like and have fun. Unsure what feminine hobbies are. I did salsa dancing for a while, and it was full of single guys. Shared experiences are a good way to meet like-minded folks or those who also want to meet people.",
