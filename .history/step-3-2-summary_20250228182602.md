# Step 3.2: Implement Semantic Search - Summary

We've successfully implemented the semantic search functionality for the LocalGuru application. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

## 1. Supabase Database Setup

- Created SQL scripts to set up the Supabase database with pgvector extension
- Designed database schema for storing Reddit posts with embeddings
- Created a queries table for logging user searches
- Implemented a vector similarity search function using pgvector

## 2. OpenAI Embeddings Integration

- Created utility functions for generating embeddings using OpenAI's embedding model
- Implemented functions to calculate cosine similarity between vectors
- Set up the infrastructure to convert text queries into vector embeddings

## 3. Reddit Data Ingestion

- Created a script to fetch travel-related posts from Reddit
- Implemented functionality to generate embeddings for Reddit posts
- Set up a pipeline to store posts with their embeddings in Supabase

## 4. Vector Search API

- Created a test API endpoint to verify vector search functionality
- Implemented query embedding generation and similarity search
- Added logging of queries and results for future analysis

## 5. Testing Interface

- Updated the test page to include a vector search testing interface
- Implemented UI for displaying semantically similar Reddit posts
- Added visual indicators for search results and similarity scores

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Data Ingestion**: Run the ingestion script to populate the database with Reddit posts
2. **Implement RAG Workflow**: Create the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflow to generate travel recommendations
3. **Connect Frontend to Backend**: Integrate the search functionality with the main application interface
4. **Enhance User Experience**: Add filtering, sorting, and pagination to the search results

The semantic search functionality is now ready to be used as part of the LocalGuru travel recommendation engine. This implementation allows us to find the most relevant Reddit posts based on the semantic meaning of user queries, rather than just keyword matching.
